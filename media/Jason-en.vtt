00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.720
hello Jason Garcia here I'm just going

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.200
to stall for time I'm just gonna read the

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.080
lyrics for Billy Jean by Michael

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.559
Jackson so uh yeah here we

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.240
go she was more like a beauty queen from

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.279
a movie

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.480
scene I said don't mind but what do you

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.240 
mean I am the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.760
one who will dance on the floor in the

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.920
round she said I am the one one who will

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.360
dance on the floor in the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.800
round people always told me be careful

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.399
of what you do and don't go around

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.039
breaking young girls

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.600
hearts and mother always told me be

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.280
careful of who you love and be careful

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.800
of what you do cause the lie becomes the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.039
truth Billy Jean is not my lover she's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.960
just a girl who claims that I'm the

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.160
one but the kid is not my son okay I'm

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
done with this
