Hello Jason Garcia here I'm just going to stall for time I'm just gonna read the
lyrics for Billy Jean by Michael Jackson so uh yeah here we
go she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said don't mind but what do you
mean I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round she said I am the one one who will
dance on the floor in the round people always told me be careful of what you do and don't go around
breaking young girls hearts and mother always told me be careful of who you love and be careful
of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth Billy Jean is not my lover she's
just a girl who claims that I'm the one but the kid is not my son okay I'm done with this
